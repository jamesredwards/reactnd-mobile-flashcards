# Udacity React Nanodegree Mobile Flashcards Project

This is the final project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.
The project was bootstrapped using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Requirements

1. npm or yarn
2. An iOS or Android simulator or the expo App to test on your own device

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`


### Notes
1. I had issues getting the Android simulator to run on Linux so it hasn't been tested for Android. Sorry Android folks!
2. It has been tested on iOS.
